# FloatingEffects
A mod which allows effects with a floating-point amplifier, only for singleplayer.

Some effects make no sense with non-integer values, thus the amplifier is cast into an int.
To give an entity an effect using the /feffect command, which has the same syntex as vanilla's /effect's.
